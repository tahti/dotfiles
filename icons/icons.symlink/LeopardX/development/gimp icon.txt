nekohayo does someone know why I have never seen any icon theme being able to change gimp's icon in the gnome menu? I'm trying to do so myself

carol nekohayo: they cache icons now
nekohayo what do you mean? (sorry I'm new at theming)
carol oh you are making a theme?
nekohayo yes, a gnome icon theme
nekohayo but gimp won't budge. I tried icon-gimp.png, gnome-gimp, gimp, and even gimp-remove-2.2
nekohayo remote*
carol well, i dunno if what i was going to say would have helped
drc nekohayo: The GIMP icon is set in the gimp.desktop -file.
nekohayo why didn't they leave that "up to the theme" ?
drc Because then every theme would have to come with a GIMP icon.
nekohayo there is no way to get a default fallback to, say, the gnome icons?
nekohayo and I've seen lots of themes carrying gimp icons but they just don't show... I was wondering
drc Well you can override it, atleast with Fedora packages.
drc Don't know how, though.
drc You should ask in #gnome.
nekohayo thanks for the info :) at least now I have some clue
nekohayo (afaik though, gimp is the only app I've seen doing that)
drc Well you're quite wrong.
nekohayo other examples?
carol xfce used a different icon
carol for gimp
drc Any app that has an icon.
carol i had to wrestle some to get the icon i wanted back
nekohayo well, I've seen blender, epiphany, etc get the theme icons.. to me gimp really is the only one.. I must have misunderstood something
nekohayo ...hey actually you're right, audacity does the same though
drc Well GIMP get's a theme icon with Fedora's default theme.
