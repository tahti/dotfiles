.SH DESCRIPTION
Vimprobable is a WWW browser that is built around the webkit library. Vimprobable is fast. 
Vimprobable comes without buttons and other graphic widgets. It is aimed at being controlled 
as mouselessly as possible. It uses keybindings that are inspired by Vim, the great editor.
.PP
Just like Vim, moving through a webpage can be done by entering commands at the keyboard.
Most of these commands require just one or two keystrokes.
.PP
Vimprobable mimics the ex-command mode of Vim. By entering a colon (:) commands like open,
set and map can be entered.

.SH MODES

Vimprobable is a modal browser. By default, it is in command mode, meaning that
any keystroke will be interpreted by the internal command engine. INSERT mode
is automatically activated if an input field on a website becomes focused.
Should this not work (due to limitations of the Webkit-GTK engine and the faulty
HTML code of some websites, this is possible), you can manually switch the
browser to PASSTHROUGH mode instead (Ctrl+Z). In INSERT and PASSTHROUGH modes,
keystrokes will not be interpreted by the browser, but passed to the underlying
engine/website.

In addition, there is HINT mode. This is activated with the "f" key by default.
Enter a the number of a link to follow it. Alternatively, you can enter the
link text (case sensitive) to narrow down your choices.

.SH QUICKMARKS

Up to 9 quickmarks can be defined. These are stored as quickmark 1 up to
quickmark 9.  You can store the URI of the current
page as quickmark with

.I :set qmark=<hotkey>

Later you can recall the quickmark with

.I q<hotkey>

Example:

:set qmark=4
Store current URI as quickmark 4

q4
Recall quickmark 4

.SH SEARCHENGINES

Searchengines let you submit queries to web search engines and similar sites
without having to type the complete URL or visit the page first.

For example, if
.I ex
is defined as the shortcut for the search at example.com, you can use "ex
search term" instead of an URL to search there for "search term".

The following search engines (and shortcuts) are already defined in config.h:

.IP i
http://ixquick.com/do/metasearch.pl?query=%s
.IP w
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Special%%3ASearch&search=%s&go=Go
.IP wd
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/w/index.php?title=Special%%3ASearch&search=%s&go=Go
.IP d
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s&t=Vimprobable
.IP dd
https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q=%s&t=Vimprobable

.P

You can always overwrite them or define your own in
.I $HOME/.config/vimprobable/vimprobablerc.
See vimprobablerc (5) for details.
.B Default search engine

If Vimprobable doesn't recognize an address as a valid URL or query to one of the
defined search engines, it will use the default search engine instead. See
.BR vimprobablerc (5)
on how to set this default.

.SH URI HANDLERS

You can define external applications to handle requests for defined URI schemas.

The following URI handlers are already defined in config.h:

.IP ftp://
x-terminal-emulator -e wget %s
.IP mailto:
x-terminal-emulator -e mutt %s
.IP vimprobableedit:
x-terminal-emulator -e vi %s

.P

See 
.BR vimprobablerc (5)
for details how to add or override these settings.

You can always overwrite them or define your own in
.I $HOME/.config/vimprobable/vimprobablerc.

The vimprobableedit protocol plays a special role.  It is used by
vimprobable when an external editor is called from within a text field.
Note that vimprobable will update the text field when the forked process
terminates.  Editors that detach from the controlling terminal (vim -g
does, for example) terminate immediately as far as vimprobable is
concerned, which means your changes will not be pulled into the text
field.  If your editor suffers from that disease, check of options that
keep it from detaching; for vim, the -f option does this.
