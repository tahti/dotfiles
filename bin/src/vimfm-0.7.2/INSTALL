Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On *nix you need:

	A working version of ncursesw and an ascii compliant terminal.
	Vifm will currently not work with Solaris curses or with PDcurses.

*nix Installation:

	./configure
	make
	("su" if you don't have access to /usr/local/bin)
	make install

	You can install vifm in your ~/ directory if you prefer.  
    Copy the vifm, vifmrc-converter and pauseme executables to where you
    want to run them.  You will also need to copy vifm help files and
    vifmrc file to ~/.vifm/.

	After you start vifm for the first time, you should edit the configuration 
	file.  It will be at ~/.vifm/vifmrc.
	If you edit the vifmrc file with vifm running any changes you make
	will be overwritten when you close vifm.

On Mac OS you need:

    Get and install libscursesw.
    Proceed like in *nix Installation section.
    Also you probably want to pass --with-gtk=no argument to ./configure
    script to omit unwanted error message when vifm starts.

On Windows you need:

	Mingw
	Pdcurses for Mingw
	Regex for Mingw
    pthreads for Windows

Windows Installation:

    cd src
    (uncomment some lines in Makefile.win below 'config:' if you want)
    make -f Makefile.win

    Copy vifm.exe, vifmrc-converter.exe and win_helper.exe to where you
    want to run them (but they all should be in the same directory).  You will
    also need to copy vifm help files and vifmrc file to %HOME%/.vifm/ or
    %APPDATA%/Vifm/.

    In case you want to be able to create symbolic links, you should set a
    "Run as Administrator" attribute for the win_helper.exe.
    Note: symbolic links are supported on Windows starting from Windows Vista.

    If you use *nix shells copy vifm-pause to some directory that is
    included to the %PATH%.  The better solution is to put it into
    %HOME%/.vifm/scripts or %APPDATA%/Vifm/scripts.

    On Windows you can also use vifm in a portable way (e.g. keep it on a
    removable device).  To do that just put your vifmrc file where vifm.exe
    is and all configuration files will be stored there.

Vim Specific Options:

	If you use vim, copy the vifm.txt file in the data/vim/doc directory to 
	your ~/.vim/doc directory or the system vim/doc directory. 
	Then launch vim ahd give the command
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc
	or
	:helptags path/to/system/vim/doc 
	depending on where you installed the vifm.txt file.

	You will also need to change set 'vimhelp' option
	in ~/.vifm/vifmrc as the default setting is to use the plain text file.

	If you want to use syntax highlighting and file type plugin for
	~/.vifm/vifmrc file, copy the data/vim/syntax/vifmrc.vim and
	data/vim/ftplugin/vifmrc.vim file to either the system wide vim syntax and
	ftplugin directories appropriately just copy the
    data/vim/ftdetect/vifm.vim file to appropriate vim configuration
    directory.  Or add to your .vimrc file commands like:
		autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead vifmrc :set filetype=vifm
		autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead ~/.vifm/colors/* :set filetype=vifm
	or if you use mode lines, add as the first or the last line to
    configuration file and color schemes:
		" vim: set filetype=vifm :

	If you want to use the vifm.vim plugin, copy the vifm.vim plugin script in
	data/vim/plugin to either the system wide vim/plugin or to ~/.vim/plugin/.
	The vifm.vim script allows you to use vifm from vim to select files.  The
	vifm.vim script is not installed by default and must be manually copied to
	the plugin directory.  Note: you need Vim 7.3 for plugin.
