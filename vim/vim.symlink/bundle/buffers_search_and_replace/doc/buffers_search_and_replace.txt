description
    The "Buffers Search & Replace" plugin is a simple but powerful buffer(s)
search & replace tool. Search results can be set in the 'delete' category and replacement
can be performed on the remaining or deleted search results.

Please report any bugs or feature requests.

Available commands :
------------------------------
    :Bs <search_regex>
    :<range> Bsc <search_regex>

The 'Bs' command is searching in all the buffers and 'Bsc' only in the current buffer.

    :Bsf <buffer_name_filter_regex> <search_regex>
    :Bse <buffer_name_exclusion_regex> <search_regex>

The 'Bsf' command is searching in all the buffers whose name match <buffer_name_filter_regex> and
'Bse' in all buffers whose name doesn't match <buffer_name_exclusion_regex>.

Default key mappings in the buffer with the results :
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  "Space"  : moves the cursor on the first result of the next buffer
  "Enter or Control-j"   : shows or jumps to the result under the cursor
  "J"  : enables or disables jumping on the buffer when pressing Enter or Control-j
  "A"  : enables or disables auto-showing the context of the results when pressing j or k
  "d" : deletes the current range search result (default: current line)
           (the deleted search results are showed at the bottom of the buffer)
  "D" : definitely deletes the current range search result (default: current line)
  "Q"  : enables or disables auto-quitting the buffer results when jumping
  "O"  : toggles between showing options or showing results
  "r"  : replace action on the non-deleted searched results
  "R"  : replace action on the deleted searched results
  "u"  : replaces this search with a newer one (with the same keyword)
  "i"  : enables or disables the search match highlighting on the buffer with the results
  "I"  : enables or disables the search match highlighting on the other buffers (not the buffer with the results)
  "x"  : enables or disables quite-full-screen
  "q"  : deletes the buffer with the results
  "?"  : toggles between showing help or showing results
